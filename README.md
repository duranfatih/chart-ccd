# chart-ccd

This chart is intended for deploying the full CCD product stack.
Including:
* data-store-api
* user-profile-api
* definition-store-api
* case-management-web (optional, enabled with a flag)

We will take small PRs and small features to this chart but more complicated needs should be handled in your own chart.

## Example configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the CCD chart and their default values.

## Development and Testing

Default configuration (e.g. default image and ingress host) is setup for sandbox. This is suitable for local development and testing.

- Ensure you have logged in with `az cli` and are using `sandbox` subscription (use `az account show` to display the current one).
- For local development see the `Makefile` for available targets.
- To execute an end-to-end build, deploy and test run `make`.
- to clean up deployed releases, charts, test pods and local charts, run `make clean`

`helm test` will deploy a busybox container alongside the release which performs a simple HTTP request against the service health endpoint. If it doesn't return `HTTP 200` the test will fail. **NOTE:** it does NOT run with `--cleanup` so the test pod will be available for inspection.

## Azure DevOps Builds
Builds are run against the 'nonprod' AKS cluster.

### Pull Request Validation
A build is triggered when pull requests are created. This build will run `helm lint`, deploy the chart using `ci-values.yaml` and run `helm test`.

### Release Build
Triggered when the repository is tagged (e.g. when a release is created). Also performs linting and testing, and will publish the chart to ACR on success.
